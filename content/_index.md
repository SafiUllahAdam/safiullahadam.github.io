      title: '🔬 My Research Interests'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research interests sit at the intersection of **semi-supervised learning**, **graph representation learning**, **computer vision**, **natural language processing**, and **large language models**, with a growing interest in **multi-agentic systems** and how heterogeneous models can collaboratively learn from one another under label scarcity.

        I am drawn to problems where data is messy, partially labelled, or distributed across modalities — exactly the conditions found in real-world healthcare, finance, and safety-critical applications. My goal is to design rigorous, reproducible, publication-quality methods that work in the real world.

        I am currently building **CLADBench**, an open-source, publication-grade benchmark for Collaborative Learning in Graph Anomaly Detection, as my M2 thesis at the LIRIS laboratory.
